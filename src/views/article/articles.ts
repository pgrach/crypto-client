        As miners ourselves, we've experienced the challenges of the Bitcoin mining industry firsthand. It's clear that advancing mining technology extends beyond just monitoring software. Addressing financial risks is the next significant challenge. This post is about how we're making our mining software smarter about finances, with the main ambition of managing the persistent issue of volatility in mining profits.
        <br/><br/>
        Mining software used to focus solely on controlling hardware – fans, hashboards, temperature, energy, inventory and service management. Over the last few years, the industry has made significant progress on that front with Operations and Maintenance (O&M) solutions developed by Foreman, Awesome miner, Block, Braiins farm monitor, Aipromap, HiveOS, among others. However, professional miners now require more than just monitoring; they need to optimize their investment for profitability by making decisions based on their unique profile, real-time market data and financial performance metrics. 
        <br/><br/>
        This evolution is becoming crucial as the semiconductor industry hits Moore's Law wall, margins shrink, and Bitcoin's volatile nature is combined with varying electricity costs.
        <br/><br/>
        Professional miners often rely on basic money-tracking systems or simple 'rules of thumb' that may miss the latest data and lead to suboptimal decisions. We aim to fix that.
        <br/><br/>
        Here's a glimpse of what we're working on currently:
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        Advanced Profitability Calculator: By analyzing historical Bitcoin data, we're developing insights into how investments might have played out, tailored to unique mining setup of anyone. We believe current mining calculators are inadequate; therefore, we are offering this improved version for free.
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        Selling Strategies Analysis: Timing and “allocation strategy” (HODL-strategy) are key in Bitcoin. We want users to be able to compare different selling approaches.
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        All that leads us to more juicy features like Real-time Profitability Monitoring, Hardware Financial Diagnostics, Cost-Efficiency Balancing, and Investment Decision Support.
        <br/><br/>      

        We believe incorporating financial intelligence features will help professional miners optimize their financial performance amid fluctuating BTC revenues.

        <b>Is Bitcoin mining still profitable, and are you essentially buying Bitcoin through mining?</b> These are common questions for anyone considering investing in mining. To answer these, a cost-benefit analysis is crucial for gaining a deeper financial understanding of this investment. This post explores two important metrics: Hardware Payback and Mine vs Buy.
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-1.png" alt="">
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        Hardware Payback evaluates the time it takes for your initial investment in mining hardware to be reimbursed through mining profits. The formula for this calculation is as follows:
        
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-2.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        <b>Cumulative Net Profit</b> is the total profit from mining after deducting operational costs (e.g., electricity). The actual profit amount can vary based on trading strategy, <a href="https://aidala.uk/articles/trading-analysis-basic-explained">which we explore separately</a>. Also, your approach to holding Bitcoin (a.k.a. "HODL" strategy) plays a crucial role—whether you choose to keep your profits in BTC or convert in USD. 
        <b>CAPEX</b> (Capital Expenditure) refers to the initial costs of starting your mining operation, including the purchase price of hardware multiplied by the quantity bought.
          
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-2-sub.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        For example, if your mining operation has generated a cumulative net profit of $10,000 and your CAPEX was $12,500, your Hardware Payback would be:
        
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-3.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        This means you have recovered 80% of your initial hardware investment through mining profits.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Mine vs Buy</b> compares the profitability of mining Bitcoin versus directly purchasing Bitcoin at market price. The formula for this metric is:
            
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-4.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        <b>Cumulative Net Profit</b> in BTC is the net profit from mining, retained in Bitcoin. This involves converting just enough Bitcoin to cover operational costs like electricity, keeping the rest intact. 
        <br/><br/>
        <b>CAPEX in BTC</b> is your initial hardware cost converted into Bitcoin, based on the USD/BTC exchange rate at the start of mining. In reality, the date of payment for the hardware often differs from the day you actually begin mining, which can lead to differences in the conversion rate. However, for simplicity in our analysis, we use the exchange rate as of the mining start date.
        <br/><br/>
        For example, if you have a cumulative net profit of 0.5 BTC and your CAPEX in BTC was 0.38 BTC, the Mine vs Buy ratio would be 132%:
        
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-5.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        This suggests that mining has been 32% more profitable than buying the equivalent amount of Bitcoin at the start of the operation.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Observations and Interpretations</b>
        <br/><br/>
        How should we interpret a situation where <b>Hardware Payback</b> is below 100%, <b>but Mine vs Buy</b> is above 100%? This scenario indicates that not all the initial CAPEX on mining hardware has been recouped through profits when measured in USD. However, the profitability of mining over buying Bitcoin has still been higher.
            
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/cost-benefit-6.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        So, which metric is more important? The answer lies in your "accumulation strategy" or HODL strategy. If you convert your Bitcoin profits into USD, then <b>Hardware Payback</b> is the more critical metric for you, as it reflects the return on your initial USD investment. However, if you are a Bitcoin hodler, preferring to keep your earnings in BTC, then <b>Mine vs Buy</b> is a more important gauge.
        <br/><br/>
        However, the practical outcome of this situation can vary depending on a few factors:
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Factors Influencing the Hardware Payback Calculation</b>
        <br/><br/>
        <b> Conversion of BTC to USD</b>: If you retain some of your mining profits in Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin rises, the USD value of these holdings could increase. This potential appreciation can significantly impact your return calculations and might accelerate the payback period.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Resale Value of Mining Equipment</b>: The mining hardware's residual value can also play a vital role in your overall profitability. Often referred to as "residual value" in accounting terms, this factor depends on demand, technological advancements, and market conditions. If your mining hardware still has resale value, this can be factored into the cumulative profits to provide a more comprehensive assessment of your ROI. We shall cover this topic in another post.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
        <br/><br/>
        Both <b>Hardware Payback</b> and <b>Mine vs Buy</b> ratios provide crucial insights into the profitability and efficiency of Bitcoin mining operations. By understanding and continually monitoring these metrics, miners can make more informed decisions regarding their investments.

        Whether you are a large-scale miner or a retail miner with just one machine, revenue recognition is a critical question. The nature of the mining business raises the issue of which currency to use for reporting revenues. 
        <br/><br/>
        In our calculator, we offer both options: USD and BTC. However, you might need some clarifications on how to use these options effectively.
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 200px; width: 100%;" src="/images/trading-analysis-1.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        While it may seem straightforward to think of revenues in BTC terms—since Bitcoin is the product your miners produce—it becomes more complicated when you need to pay your bills, which are usually in USD. Converting your costs into BTC can be a useful mental exercise or practical if you sell only enough bitcoins to cover your costs. But it can also be confusing. A useful parallel is an oil company calculating revenue in barrels of oil and converting costs into barrels. This approach can be insightful but not always practical in the fiat world.
        
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/trading-analysis-2.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        
        Alternatively, if you choose USD, there is a natural tendency to think of revenue based on the fair market value of Bitcoin at the time it is mined. However, the actual value in USD is realized when the mined Bitcoin is sold and converted to fiat currency. This is similar to oil, where the value is recognized when the oil is sold, not at the moment of extraction. Essentially, the key question is when miners sell their mined bitcoins.
        <br/><br/>
        No other mining calculators provide this line of thinking or propose alternatives for comparing scenarios, so we decided to make it ourselves. We introduced three simple strategies:
        <br/><br/>
        1) <b>Once a Month</b>: Using the conversion rate on the last date of the month.
        2) <b>Once a Week</b>: Using the conversion rate on the last day of the week.
        3) <b>Every Day</b>: Using the conversion rate on the last hour of the day.
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%;" src="/images/trading-analysis-3.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        
        These strategies result in different revenue values, which influence most downstream financial metrics.
        <br/><br/>
        For example, consider mining with the Whatsminer M32 model in 2023 at 5.5 cents/kWh electricity cost. If you were selling BTC at the end of the month, your revenues would be different compared to selling weekly or daily. In fact, you would only be profitable if selling at the end of the month:
        <br/><br/>
        <img style="max-width: 700px; width: 100%;" src="/images/trading-analysis-4.png" alt="">
        <br/><br/>
        So I hope this simple basic example showed you the importance of timing and made it clearer how to think in terms of revenue in USD and in BTC. There is a lot more to cover and to add.
        <br/><br/>
        Future improvements will address questions: do you sell all bitcoins or only part? What if we only convert a portion to cover operating costs? How does it change reporting - adding realized and unrealized gains/losses? This is the issue we are examining for our advanced scenario, and we are excited to implement more specific cases based on your feedback.
        <br/><br/>
        Our ML team is working on algorithmic trading models. These models use real-time price and volume data to execute trades based on predefined criteria. Imagine you are not just picking a defined strategy between daily, weekly, or monthly selling, but you follow a trained model based on inputs you select. Or you follow investment strategies via third-party trading bots.
