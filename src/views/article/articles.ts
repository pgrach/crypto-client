        As miners ourselves, we've experienced the challenges of the Bitcoin mining industry firsthand. It's clear that advancing mining technology extends beyond just monitoring software. Addressing financial risks is the next significant challenge. This post is about how we're making our mining software smarter about finances, with the main ambition of managing the persistent issue of volatility in mining profits.
        <br/><br/>
        Mining software used to focus solely on controlling hardware – fans, hashboards, temperature, energy, inventory and service management. Over the last few years, the industry has made significant progress on that front with Operations and Maintenance (O&M) solutions developed by Foreman, Awesome miner, Block, Braiins farm monitor, Aipromap, HiveOS, among others. However, professional miners now require more than just monitoring; they need to optimize their investment for profitability by making decisions based on their unique profile, real-time market data and financial performance metrics. 
        <br/><br/>
        This evolution is becoming crucial as the semiconductor industry hits Moore's Law wall, margins shrink, and Bitcoin's volatile nature is combined with varying electricity costs.
        <br/><br/>
        Professional miners often rely on basic money-tracking systems or simple 'rules of thumb' that may miss the latest data and lead to suboptimal decisions. We aim to fix that.
        <br/><br/>
        Here's a glimpse of what we're working on currently:

        <br/><br/>
        Advanced Profitability Calculator: By analyzing historical Bitcoin data, we're developing insights into how investments might have played out, tailored to unique mining setup of anyone. We believe current mining calculators are inadequate; therefore, we are offering this improved version for free.
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        Investment Performance Visualization: We're exploring ways to visually present each miner's investment journey, simplifying complex information and highlighting key factors behind ROI.
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        Selling Strategies Analysis: Timing and “allocation strategy” (HODL-strategy) are key in Bitcoin. We want users to be able to compare different selling approaches.
        <br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        All that leads us to more juicy features like Real-time Profitability Monitoring, Hardware Financial Diagnostics, Cost-Efficiency Balancing, and Investment Decision Support.
        <br/><br/>      

        We believe incorporating financial intelligence features will help professional miners optimize their financial performance amid fluctuating BTC revenues.
